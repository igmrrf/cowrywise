# Backend Assessment

You have been tasked to develop an application to manage books in a library. With your application, users can browse through the catalogue of books and borrow them. You are to build 2 independent API services for this application. 

1. Frontend API

  This API will be used to 

  * Enroll users into the library using their email, firstname and lastname.
  * List all available books
  * Get a single book by its ID
  * Filter books 
    * by publishers e.g Wiley, Apress, Manning 
    * by category e.g fiction, technology, science
  * Borrow books by id (specify how long you want it for in days)



2. Backend/Admin API

  This API will be used by an admin to:

  * Add new books to the catalogue
  * Remove a book from the catalogue.
  * Fetch / List users enrolled in the library.
  * Fetch/List users and the books they have borrowed
  * Fetch/List the books that are not available for borrowing (showing the day it will be available)



Requirements

* The endpoints need not be authenticated
* The API can be built using any python framework
* Design the models as you deem fit. 
* A book that has been lent out should no longer be available in the catalogue.
* The two services should use different data stores.
* Device a way to communicate changes between the two services. i.e when the admin adds a book to the catalogue via the admin api, the frontend api should also be updated with the latest book added by the admin.
* The project should be deployed using docker containers
* Add necessary unit/integration tests.





Please add your git repo for the project (In the Job Application Form)
